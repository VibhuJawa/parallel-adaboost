# Parallelizing AdaBoost on Multi Core Machines using open MP in C++

AdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, is a type of boosting algorithm which combines several weak classifiers to create one strong classifier. AdaBoosts fundamental nature doesnâ€™t allow for parallelizing finding the weak classifiers, we present a way which helps achieve nearly 22.14x times the speedup compared to a serial implementaiton. In this project, we develop a parallel AdaBoost algorithm that exploits the multiple cores in a CPU via light weight threads. We propose different algorithms for different types of datasets and machines.



### Prerequisites

Python3: To generate the data set for experimentation

C++ with OpenMP 
Refer this for learning more about open mp and multi threading with C++.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
1. Run c++/.create_data.sh to create the data set
```

```
2. In adaboost.cpp you can include 3 different header files each 
   having differnt implimentations of the algorithim.
  
      1. Parallization to find the best feature threhold parallel- adaboost/c++/adaboost.h

      2. Parallization everywhere parallel-adaboost/c++/adaboost_best.h
```

```
3. We also time different transposse implimentations in  parallel-adaboost/c++/time_transpose.cpp

```
